# PRNG C-32: A Fast, Statistically-Strong Pseudorandom Number Generator ðŸŽ²

![PRNG C-32](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRNG%20C--32-v1.0.0-blue)

Welcome to the **PRNG C-32** repository! This project offers a fast and statistically-strong pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that produces 32-bit integers. With a minimum period of \(2^{32}\), it ensures a reliable source of randomness for various applications, from simulations to cryptographic uses.

## Features

- **Fast Execution**: The PRNG is optimized for speed, making it suitable for high-performance applications.
- **Statistical Strength**: It meets high standards for randomness, making it useful in simulations and cryptography.
- **32-Bit Output**: Generates 32-bit integers, which are widely used in various programming tasks.
- **Long Period**: The minimum period of \(2^{32}\) ensures that the sequence of numbers will not repeat frequently, which is critical for many applications.

## Installation

To get started with PRNG C-32, you need to clone the repository and build the project. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cupholder1234/prng-c-32.git
   cd prng-c-32
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. You can now use the PRNG in your projects.

## Usage

To use the PRNG, include the header file in your C project:

```c
#include "prng.h"
```

Initialize the PRNG with a seed:

```c
uint32_t seed = 12345; // Choose a seed
prng_init(seed);
```

Generate random numbers:

```c
uint32_t random_number = prng_next();
```

## Examples

Here are some example codes to illustrate how to use the PRNG:

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "prng.h"

int main() {
    uint32_t seed = 12345;
    prng_init(seed);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("Random Number %d: %u\n", i + 1, prng_next());
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Random Number in a Range

To generate a random number within a specific range, you can use the modulo operator:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "prng.h"

int main() {
    uint32_t seed = 67890;
    prng_init(seed);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        uint32_t random_number = prng_next() % 100; // Random number between 0 and 99
        printf("Random Number %d: %u\n", i + 1, random_number);
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Performance

The performance of PRNG C-32 has been tested against various benchmarks. The results show that it outperforms many other PRNGs in terms of speed while maintaining high statistical quality. Below are some key metrics:

- **Speed**: Capable of generating millions of random numbers per second.
- **Memory Usage**: Lightweight and efficient, requiring minimal memory overhead.
- **Statistical Tests**: Passed numerous tests for randomness, including the Diehard tests and the NIST test suite.
